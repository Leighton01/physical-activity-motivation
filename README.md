# Overview
 
This is the dissertation for my MSc Data Analytics and Social Statistics that explores the age differences in motivation for physical activity. This project uses Sport England survey data to examine how age moderates the relationship between perceived motivation and physical activity within established motivation frameworks (eg., Self-Determination Theory). The analysis combines multigroup structural equation modelling (SEM), latent clasas analysis (LCA), and multinominal logistic regression (GLM). Results suggest age-related differences in the strength and configuration of motive profiles, although causal interpretation is limited by the observational design.
